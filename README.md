# GeForce NOW Unlocker

## Description

This extension allows you to use GeForce NOW in your browser using any operating system.

## Installation

### Google Chrome (recommended)

#### Installation Procedure

Install the extension from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chgiddljhokfbppnhfphdabejocpopgk).

### Mozilla Firefox

#### Installation Procedure

Install the extension from [Firefox Extensions](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/geforce-now-unlocker).

#### Troubleshooting

Firefox does not play very well with GeForce NOW so it is possible you will run into some issues.
If you are having an issue and find a workaround please let me know and I will add it to the readme.

- Unable to start games.
  - Displayed Error: Check your network connection and try again. ERROR CODE: 0x00000157
  - Solution: Open the Site information panel (padlock icon at the start of the address bar) then change the Autoplay permissions to "Allow Audio and Video"

## Usage

Simply navigate to https://play.geforcenow.com and start playing!

## How it works

The extension simply spoofs the user agent string in the request headers, making GFN think we are using ChromeOS.
