# GeForce NOW Enabler

## Description
This extension allows you to use the GeForce NOW web version using any operating system.

## Usage
- Install the extension from the Chrome Web Store.
- Open https://play.geforcenow.com.

## How it works
The extension simply spoofs the user agent string in the request headers, making GFN think we are using ChromeOS.
